# **Time-Trading App PRD**

**Project:** Time-Trading App (MVP)  
 **Owner:** Josue  
 **Date:** January 30, 2025  
 **Status:** Draft v2.1

---

## **Problem**

Gen Z and Millennial social media users struggle to disengage from negative content loops ("doomscrolling") on platforms like TikTok and Reddit, often entering a state of "problematic use" where they feel unable to stop despite recognizing the negative impact on their mood and schedule.

---

## **Impact**

* **Mental & Physical Health:** Users experience increased anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances due to prolonged exposure to distressing content.  
* **Loss of Function:** Doomscrollers are 4x more likely to miss deadlines or life opportunities compared to non-doomscrollers due to distraction.  
* **Loss of Time:** The average user loses 3.5 hours per week (during workdays alone) to doomscrolling, often triggered by political content or "brain rot".

---

## **Evidence**

* **Prevalence:** 64% of Americans describe themselves as doomscrollers; this spikes to 81% for Gen Z.  
* **Frequency:** 43% of Americans doomscroll daily; 26% do so multiple times a day (Morning Consult).  
* **Severity:** A 2024 WHO report found over 10% of adolescents struggle to control their usage, indicating behavior closer to addiction than habit.

---

## **Opportunity**

**OPPORTUNITY STATEMENT:** Enable Gen Z and Millennial "doomscrollers" to interrupt passive consumption loops and immediately convert that time into micro-progress towards personal goals (e.g., learning a skill, fitness), reclaiming an average of 3.5 hours per week for meaningful activity through daily intentional practice.

### **Expected Outcomes**

* **User Outcome:** Users reduce passive screen time by 20% within 30 days and complete at least 1 productive session every day (7-day streak target).  
* **Product Outcome:** Achieve 25% Day-30 retention, proving daily expiration enforcement works where willpower-based apps fail.  
* **Strategic Outcome:** Position the product not just as a "blocker," but as a "daily intentionality coach," differentiating from OS-level restrictions like Apple Screen Time and accumulation-based apps.

---

## **Market Validation (Why Now)**

* **The "Attention Crisis" Peak:** Algorithms have optimized passive consumption to the point of "problematic use" for 10% of adolescents, creating an urgent demand for counter-tools.  
* **The "Brain Rot" Backlash:** 42% of users specifically identify "brain rot" content as a trigger, signaling a cultural readiness to shift away from low-value content.  
* **Political Fatigue:** With 51% of Americans citing politics as a doomscrolling trigger, the current political climate creates a massive, immediate desire for tools that filter out high-stress noise.

## **Users & Needs**

### **WHO:**

#### **Primary Users:**

**The "Powerless Scroller"** \- Gen Z and Millennial social media users (ages 18-35) who recognize they lack self-control with social media apps. They've tried built-in Screen Time limits but always click "Ignore." They want a system that enforces boundaries for them and makes productive time feel rewarding instead of restrictive. They need daily structure because they can't trust themselves to manage accumulated time wisely.

#### **Secondary Users:**

**The "Aspiring Optimizer"** \- Gen Z and Millennial users (ages 22-35) who don't identify as addicted but want to intentionally structure their time. They view the app as a productivity framework that gamifies balance \- treating leisure time as something to be earned and budgeted rather than consumed mindlessly. They're drawn to the quantified self aspect and the psychological satisfaction of "guilt-free" scrolling within daily boundaries.

### **NEEDS:**

#### **Must Have:**

1. **As a Powerless Scroller, I need my vice apps (TikTok, Instagram, Twitter) to be completely blocked by default**, so that I cannot open them unconsciously during moments of boredom or stress and immediately fall into a doomscrolling loop.  
2. **As a Powerless Scroller, I need to see verified proof of my productive time (via iOS Screen Time data) before unlocking vice apps**, so that I trust the system is fair and know I actually earned my leisure time rather than gaming the system. (Note: Aspiring Optimizers value this for the satisfaction of quantified achievement)  
3. **As a Powerless Scroller, I need my earned minutes to work as a shared bank across all my vice apps (not locked to one app)**, so that I have flexibility in how I spend my earned time based on what I actually need in the moment (checking Instagram DMs vs. watching TikTok).  
4. **As a Powerless Scroller, I need the app to automatically track my productive time in native apps (Kindle, Duolingo) without forcing me to use web versions**, so that I can maintain my existing reading/learning habits and earn credit seamlessly in the background.  
5. **As a Powerless Scroller, I need real-time deduction from my time bank as I use vice apps**, so that I feel the immediate "cost" of scrolling and can make conscious decisions about whether to continue or save my remaining minutes for later. (Note: Aspiring Optimizers value this as budget awareness)

#### **Should Have:**

6. **As a Powerless Scroller, I need notifications when I hit productivity milestones (e.g., 15 min, 30 min earned)**, so that I'm reminded of my progress and feel motivated to continue building my time bank rather than giving up.  
7. **As a Powerless Scroller, I need my earned time to expire when the day ends at midnight**, so that I'm forced to start each day fresh rather than using accumulated time from yesterday to doomscroll first thing in the morning. This prevents binge-earning patterns and reinforces daily intentional practice.

#### **Nice to Have:**

8. **As an Aspiring Optimizer, I need to adjust my productive-to-vice app ratio (e.g., 2:1 instead of 1:1)**, so that I can increase difficulty as I build better habits over time and challenge myself further.

---

## **Proposed Solution**

**PROPOSED SOLUTION:**

A time-trading iOS app featuring a supportive accountability buddy (Clepsy) that blocks distracting social media apps by default. The app only unlocks these "vice apps" when users earn equivalent time through productive activities tracked via Apple's Screen Time API. Clepsy uses a functional hourglass body to visualize the user’s balance and goal progress, making enforcement feel collaborative rather than punitive.

### **TOP 3 MVP VALUE PROPS:**

1. **The Vitamin (Must-Have Baseline):**  
    **Verified blocking that can't be bypassed** \- Your vice apps (TikTok, Instagram) are locked by iOS until you earn access, eliminating the "Ignore Limit" button that makes other blocking apps useless for people with zero self-control.  
2. **The Painkiller (Core Problem Solver):**  
    **Force conscious decisions, not autopilot scrolling** \- Every time you try to open TikTok, you see exactly what it costs (23 minutes of productive time), breaking the unconscious habit loop that turns "just a quick check" into 2-hour doomscrolling sessions you never intended.  
3. **The Steroid (Magic Moment):**  
    **Every day is a fresh start** \- Your time bank resets at midnight, eliminating the ability to coast on yesterday's productivity. This forces daily intentionality and prevents the "binge and coast" pattern that sabotages long-term habit change. You can't game the system by banking hours on Sunday to doomscroll guilt-free on Monday morning.

---

## **Goals & Non-Goals**

### **GOALS:**

1. **Break the autopilot doomscrolling habit** \- Enable users to reduce unintentional vice app usage by 50% within 30 days by forcing conscious unlock decisions instead of mindless opening.  
2. **Drive daily productive behavior** \- Users complete at least 1 productive session every day (7-day streak target within first 30 days), preventing binge-earn patterns and reinforcing daily intentional practice.  
3. **Achieve product-market fit with retention** \- Reach 25% Day-30 retention among Powerless Scrollers, proving the enforcement mechanism works where willpower-based apps fail.  
4. **Validate core mechanic before monetization** \- Gather qualitative feedback and usage data to inform future premium features. Launch free to remove barriers to testing the time-trading concept.

### **NON-GOALS:**

1. **Not building buddy/social features in MVP** \- No password-protected unlocks, shared leaderboards, or friend challenges. These are V1.5 features pending core value validation.  
2. **Not supporting Android** \- iOS-only for MVP due to Screen Time API dependency. Android requires different technical approach (accessibility services), delayed to V2.  
3. **Not offering custom exchange rates** \- MVP is strict 1:1 time trading (1 min productive \= 1 min vice). Variable ratios (2:1, etc.) are V2 difficulty settings.  
4. **Not building in-app productivity tools** \- No web browser for Kindle, no built-in journal, no meditation timer. Users must use their native apps.  
5. **Not offering time rollover or banking** \- MVP enforces daily expiration at midnight. Weekend rollover or accumulation features are V1.5/V2 considerations pending user feedback.  
6. **Not monetizing at launch** \- Free for all users to maximize adoption and validate core mechanics before introducing paid tiers.

## **Requirements**

Requirements are organized by user journeys to show the end-to-end experience of time-trading. We focus on the Powerless Scroller's journey since they represent our primary user and most critical use case.

**Priority legend:**

* **\[P0\]** \= MVP for GA release (must-have to launch)  
* **\[P1\]** \= Important for delightful experience (should-have)  
* **\[P2\]** \= Nice-to-have (can defer to V2)

---

### **USER JOURNEY 1: First-Time User Setup**

**Context:** This is the make-or-break moment. Users must understand the time-trading concept and grant necessary permissions. We're optimizing for clarity and trust—if they don't complete setup, they never experience the core value. Target: \<2 minutes to first blocked app encounter.

#### **Onboarding & Permission Request**

* **\[P0\]** User can see explanation of how time-trading works (earn productive time → unlock vice apps → **time expires at midnight**)  
* **\[P0\]** User can grant Family Controls permission via iOS system prompt  
  * Clear explanation of why permission is needed before showing system prompt  
* **\[P0\]** User sees error message if permission is denied with option to retry  
* **\[P1\]** User can skip onboarding and go straight to setup if they already understand the concept  
* **\[P1\]** Onboarding explicitly explains daily expiration: "Your time bank resets at midnight—earn fresh time every day"  
* **\[P2\]** User can watch video tutorial explaining time-trading concept

#### **Select Vice Apps to Block**

* **\[P0\]** User can see list of common vice apps (TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, etc.)  
* **\[P0\]** User can select which apps to block (minimum 1 required)  
* **\[P0\]** User can search for apps not in the suggested list  
* **\[P1\]** User can see how many hours/week they currently spend on each app (via Screen Time data)  
  * Helps prioritize which apps to block first  
* **\[P2\]** User can select app categories (Social Media, News, Gaming) to block entire groups

#### **Select Productive Apps to Track**

* **\[P0\]** User can see list of common productive apps (Kindle, Duolingo, Audible, Khan Academy, etc.)  
* **\[P0\]** User can select which apps to track (minimum 1 required)  
* **\[P0\]** User can search for apps not in the suggested list  
* **\[P1\]** User can add custom apps from their phone to productive list  
* **\[P2\]** User can categorize productive apps (Reading, Learning, Fitness)

* **\[P1\]** User can enable/disable low balance warnings (during active use)  
* **\[P2\]** User can set quiet hours for notifications (e.g., no notifications after 10 PM)

---

### **USER JOURNEY 2: Earning Time (The Productive Session)**

**Context:** This is where users build their time bank. The system must accurately track native app usage without any action required from the user. We're optimizing for seamless background tracking and timely notifications.

#### **Passive Tracking**

* #### **\[P0\] 60-Second Warmup:** User must use a productive app for 60 consecutive seconds before tracking starts to ensure genuine intent and prevent "gaming" the system.

* #### **\[P0\] Session Pause/Resume (2-Minute Timeout):** Brief interruptions (e.g., a phone call) under 120 seconds allow the session to resume without a new warmup. If the user is away for \>2 minutes, the session ends and credits earned time to the bank.

* #### **\[P0\] Screen Lock Behavior:** Locking the phone pauses tracking immediately to enforce active engagement and prevent "overnight farming".

* #### **\[P0\] System Monitoring:** Passive tracking is handled via `DeviceActivityMonitor` and runs in the background even when Clepsy is closed.

#### **Milestone Notifications**

* **\[P0\]** User receives notification when hitting earning milestone (e.g., "🎉 15 minutes earned\!")  
  * Notification shows current total earned today  
* **\[P0\]** User can tap notification to open app and see full balance  
* **\[P1\]** User sees progress bar in notification showing progress to next milestone  
* **\[P2\]** User can snooze milestone notifications temporarily

---

### **USER JOURNEY 3: Attempting to Open Vice App (The Block)**

**Context:** This is the critical intervention moment. User tries to open TikTok on autopilot—we must break that pattern with a clear, fair shield screen. We're optimizing for conscious decision-making without causing rage-quit frustration.

#### **Shield Screen Display**

* **\[P0\]** User sees custom shield screen when attempting to open blocked vice app  
  * Shield is triggered by iOS DeviceActivity framework  
* **\[P0\]** Shield screen shows current available balance from productive time  
  * Example: "You have 23 minutes available"  
* **\[P0\]** Shield screen displays expiration indicator  
  * Example: "Expires at midnight (5 hours remaining)"  
* **\[P0\]** Shield screen displays last updated timestamp  
  * Example: "Updated 30 seconds ago"  
* **\[P0\]** Shield screen shows button: "Unlock \[App Name\] for \[X\] minutes"  
  * Button displays exact available time  
* **\[P0\] Character-Driven UI:** The shield screen must prominently feature the Clepsy character in a **Patient** state to break the autopilot habit with empathy rather than judgment.  
* **\[P0\] Visual Data Viz:** The sand level in Clepsy’s hourglass body must reflect the user’s current progress toward their daily productivity goal  
* **\[P1\]** User can tap refresh icon to manually update balance if needed  
  * Handles \~1 minute DeviceActivityReport delay  
* **\[P2\]** User sees motivational message or productivity tip on shield

#### **No Balance Scenario**

* **\[P0\]** User sees shield screen showing "0 minutes available" when bank is empty  
* **\[P0\]** User sees button: "Earn Time Now" which opens main app  
* **\[P0\]** Shield screen clearly explains reason for zero balance:  
  * **If morning (first encounter after midnight):** "🌅 Fresh Start: 0 minutes available. Yesterday's balance expired at midnight. Earn new time to unlock \[App\] today."  
  * **If used all time:** "⏰ You've spent all your earned time today. Earn more to continue."  
* **\[P1\]** First-time expiration educational tooltip (shows once only):  
  * "💡 Your time expired at midnight. This happens every day—it's not a bug, it's a feature. Each morning is a fresh start."  
  * Appears only the first time user encounters expired balance  
* **\[P1\]** User sees suggestions for quick productive activities (Read 5 min, Practice language 2 min)  
* **\[P2\]** User sees streak info ("You've earned time 5 days in a row—keep it up\!")

---

### **USER JOURNEY 4: Unlocking & Spending Time (The Reward)**

**Context:** User has earned time and wants to use it. This should feel like a fair transaction—they paid for this, so we celebrate it while tracking accurately. We're optimizing for guilt-free enjoyment and accurate deduction.

#### **Claiming & Unlocking**

* **\[P0\]** User taps "Unlock \[App\] for \[X\] minutes" button on shield  
* **\[P0\]** System records claimed amount and timestamp  
* **\[P0\]** System removes shield from vice app for exact duration  
  * Uses ManagedSettings framework to lift restriction  
* **\[P0\]** Vice app opens immediately after unlock  
* **\[P1\]** User sees confirmation message: "✅ \[X\] minutes unlocked. Enjoy\!"  
* **\[P2\]** User can choose to unlock for less time than available  
  * Example: Have 30 min, only unlock 15 min

#### **Real-Time Deduction**

* **\[P0\]** System tracks vice app usage in real-time (1-second increments)  
* **\[P0\]** System deducts time from bank as user scrolls  
* **\[P0\]** System automatically re-shields app when balance hits zero mid-session  
  * App locks immediately, no grace period  
* **\[P1\]** User sees notification: "⏰ Time's up\! Earn more to continue"  
* **\[P2\]** User can see countdown timer in notification showing remaining time

#### **Multiple Vice Apps**

* **\[P0\]** User can switch between different vice apps using same bank balance  
  * Example: Use 10 min on TikTok, 13 min on Instagram from same 23 min bank  
* **\[P0\]** System continues deducting from same shared bank regardless of which vice app is active  
* **\[P1\]** User can see which app they're currently spending time in  
* **\[P2\]** User can see breakdown of how much time spent on each vice app today

#### **Daily Expiration System**

* **\[P0\]** System resets time bank to zero at midnight (local timezone)  
* **\[P0\]** User sees clear explanation on shield next morning:  
  * "🌅 Fresh Start: Yesterday's balance expired. Earn new time to unlock."  
* **\[P0\]** System handles midnight reset without grace period  
  * If user is mid-session in vice app at 11:59 PM, app locks at 12:00 AM  
  * Shield appears immediately showing 0 balance  
* **\[P0\]** System handles timezone changes correctly  
  * Expiration stays locked to user's current local midnight  
  * If user travels across timezones, expiration adjusts to new local time  
* **\[P1\]** System tracks and displays "unused minutes lost to expiration" in weekly summary  
  * Helps users understand their earning vs. spending patterns  
  * Shown retrospectively, not as real-time pressure  
* **\[P2\]** User can see "typical expiration pattern" in analytics  
  * "You typically let 15 minutes expire on weekdays"  
  * Educational insight, not nagging reminder

---

### **USER JOURNEY 5: Checking Balance & History (The Dashboard)**

**Context:** User wants to see their current balance, earning history, and usage patterns. This builds awareness and reinforces the time-as-currency mental model. We're optimizing for transparency and motivation.

#### **Current Balance View**

* **\[P0\]** User can see current available balance prominently displayed with expiration indicator  
  * Example: "🎯 Balance: 47 minutes (expires at midnight)"  
* **\[P0\]** User can see visual countdown showing hours until midnight reset

---

### **USER JOURNEY 6: Managing Settings (Ongoing Customization)**

**Context:** User wants to adjust their blocked apps, productive apps, or notification preferences as their habits change. We're optimizing for flexibility without breaking core enforcement.

#### **App Management**

* **\[P0\]** User can add new vice apps to block list  
* **\[P0\]** User can add new productive apps to track list  
* **\[P0\] App Selection Conflict Resolution:** The system prevents the same app from existing in both "Vice" and "Productive" lists. Adding an app to one list automatically removes it from the other with a confirmation toast.  
* **\[P0\] Minimum App Requirement:** Users must maintain at least one blocked vice app and one tracked productive app; the system will block the removal of the final app in either list.  
* **\[P1\] Silent Recovery:** If a missed midnight reset is detected on app launch, the system performs the reset immediately without user notification to maintain a seamless "Fresh Start".  
* **\[P1\]** User can remove apps from vice list  
  * Requires confirmation: "Are you sure? This app will no longer be blocked"  
* **\[P1\]** User can remove apps from productive list  
* **\[P2\]** User can temporarily pause blocking for specific app (24-hour emergency override)  
  * Requires typing "I understand this defeats the purpose"

#### **Notification Settings**

* **\[P0\]** User can change milestone notification threshold  
* **\[P0\]** User can disable all notifications  
* **\[P1\]** User can enable/disable specific notification types:  
  * Productivity milestones (earned 15 min, 30 min, etc.)  
  * Low balance warnings (when \<5 minutes remaining during active use)  
  * Time expired notification (when balance runs out mid-session)  
* **\[P1\]** User can enable/disable morning "fresh start" reminder  
  * Optional 8 AM notification: "🌅 New day, new time bank. Earn your freedom today."  
  * Default: OFF (users discover reset organically)  
* **\[P2\]** User can set quiet hours

#### **Account & Data**

* **\[P0\]** User can see app version and iOS compatibility info  
* **\[P1\]** User can contact support from settings  
* **\[P1\]** User can view privacy policy and terms  
* **\[P1\]** User can see explanation of daily expiration system  
  * "Why does my time expire?" education page  
* **\[P2\]** User can export their earning/spending history as CSV  
* **\[P2\]** User can reset all data and start fresh

#### **Error Handling & Edge Cases**

* **\[P0\]** User sees clear error message if Family Controls permission is revoked  
  * With instructions to re-enable in iOS Settings  
* **\[P0\]** User sees error if DeviceActivityReport fails to load  
  * With manual refresh option  
* **\[P0\]** System handles phone restart gracefully (shields remain active, balance preserved until midnight)  
* **\[P0\]** System handles timezone changes correctly (expiration stays locked to user's local midnight)  
* **\[P1\]** User sees warning if productive app is uninstalled  
  * "Kindle removed from your phone. Remove from productive list?"  
* **\[P1\]** System handles iOS updates that might break Screen Time API  
  * Graceful degradation with notification to user  
* **\[P2\]** User can report bugs/issues directly from app

## **Future Considerations**

### **V1.5 \- Social Accountability Layer**

**Deferred from MVP to validate core concept first**

* **Buddy System for Emergency Unlocks**  
  * Password-protected emergency access controlled by trusted friend  
  * Buddy must also download app to receive password  
  * Creates viral growth loop ("invite buddy to unlock feature")  
* **Social Features**  
  * Shared progress tracking and leaderboards  
  * Friend challenges ("Read more than me this week")  
  * Accountability notifications to buddy when emergency unlock requested  
  * Daily streak competitions  
* **Rationale for Deferring:**  
  * Core value prop must work solo first  
  * Adds complexity to onboarding (requires inviting another user)  
  * Social features amplify engagement but aren't required to solve the core problem  
  * Will add post-launch once we validate time-trading concept works

### **V1.5 \- Potential Premium Features**

  * Shared accountability features  
  * Age-appropriate customization

---

## **Technical Dependencies**

### **iOS Frameworks Required:**

* **FamilyControls** \- One-time permission request for Screen Time management  
* **ManagedSettings** \- Shield/unshield vice apps programmatically  
* **DeviceActivity** \- Monitor app usage and set threshold-based triggers  
* **DeviceActivityReport** \- Display usage data within app interface

### **Minimum Requirements:**

* **iOS Version:** iOS 16+ (DeviceActivityReport improvements)  
* **Device:** iPhone only (iPad support V2)

### **Key Technical Constraints:**

* DeviceActivityReport updates approximately every 1 minute (not real-time)  
* Usage data is tokenized and cannot be exported off-device for privacy  
* Shields persist across device restarts (handled by iOS)  
* Midnight reset requires scheduled DeviceActivity event with timezone awareness

### **Daily Expiration Implementation:**

* Use DeviceActivity schedule to trigger midnight reset  
* Handle timezone changes (travel scenarios)  
* Preserve balance calculation accuracy across device restarts  
* No background notifications before expiration (users discover organically)

---

## **Open Questions**

1. **Pricing Strategy:** How do we monetize post-launch?  
   * **DECISION:** Launch completely free for MVP. Monetization strategy deferred to post-launch based on user feedback and retention data.  
   * Future considerations: Premium analytics, buddy features, custom ratios could be monetization paths in V1.5+  
2. **Onboarding Friction:** How many steps before user hits first shield?  
   * **DECISION:** \<2 minutes to first blocked app encounter. Speed is critical.  
   * Implementation: Streamline to 3 screens max (explain concept → select vice apps → grant permission → done)  
3. **App Store Category:** Productivity? Health & Fitness? Lifestyle?  
   * **DECISION:** Productivity (primary) \+ Health & Fitness (secondary) for discoverability.  
4. **First-Time Expiration Education:** How do we teach users about midnight reset?  
   * **RECOMMENDATION:** One-time tooltip on first morning shield encounter: "💡 Your time expired at midnight. This happens every day—it's not a bug, it's a feature. Each morning is a fresh start."  
   * After first encounter, users discover pattern organically  
   * No proactive warnings or reminders before expiration  
5. **Midnight Grace Period:** Should there be buffer time after midnight for users mid-session?  
   * **DECISION:** No grace period for MVP. Hard reset at midnight reinforces the boundary.  
   * If users complain about being kicked out mid-TikTok at 12:00 AM, we can revisit in V1.5.  
6. **Emergency Override Mechanism:** How to handle legitimate emergencies (urgent DM, etc.)?  
   * **DEFER TO POST-LAUNCH:** Don't include in MVP. If users request it, add in V1.5 with significant friction:  
     * Requires typing long phrase: "I understand this defeats the purpose of the app"  
     * 24-hour cooldown period  
     * Breaks earning streak  
   * Philosophy: Real emergencies are rare. Most "emergencies" are rationalizations.
